"Diabetes-prediction-using-ML-Algorithm's"
So far we have used :
> SVM(support vector machine)
> Random Forest
> MLP(multi layered perceptron)
> Logistic Regression
> Currently trying XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
> first used 1lakh entries dataset then switched to PIMA dataset for diabetes since this was for research purpose.

Any modification
